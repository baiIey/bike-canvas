# Bike Canvas
This project and its [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11AXoIEOM2QBKDXbr_oeL1rdR6JgghLhevXqeBKCfE48/edit?usp=sharing) describe the well-researched psychological phenomenon of overlooking cotidian objects. Then we will explore the consequences of such oversight. Finally, we will consider the outcomes of an experiment in which we asked 10,000 randomly self-selected people to draw a bicycle without looking at a picture.
